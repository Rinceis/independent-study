  p Welcome to #{title}

  p pug is looking to be more of a challenge than I thought it would be to understand, but I'm working at it.

  p For example, linking to <a href = "//google.com"> google </a> isn't too much different from plain old HTML.
  p I could also link to the next page, for example. <a href = "/info"> That one</a>is a little less well put together, but it shows you what I plan to be doing!
  p Look at this rabbit!
